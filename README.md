# Project3
The Doodle Jump inspired project.

The soft deadline is 11/25/18
We want every feature implemented on the Sunday before the actual assignment deadline,
so we have time to debug/fix any problems that we have.

Anything changes should be pushed into sub-master first, so other people can check for any bugs/mistakes in the code.
If most of us agree on the changes or if it is necessary (foundational/features to be build upon), then we would push
changes to master.

I think we should decide an a theme for the game (Cyberpunk city, medevial castle) so that
we can base some of the mechanics and art style off of the theme (eaiser yo)

The project's checklist(what we should be doing) is in the projects tab.

BTW I'm gonna send this repository to Jason Leigh so he can see who's slacking off XD
