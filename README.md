# Project3
The Doodle Jump inspired project.

The soft deadline is 11/25/18
We want every feature implemented on the Sunday before the actual assignment deadline,
so we have time to debug/fix any problems that we have.

I think we should decide an a theme for the game (Cyberpunk city, medevial castle) so that
we can base some of the mechanics and art style off of the theme (eaiser yo)

The project's checklist(what we should be doing) is in the projects tab.
